.SH PURPOSE

.SH DESCRIPTION
utf-text will convert <utf> text to <text> (specified with "to" clause). If <text> is omitted, then the result of conversion is output.

<utf> is a string that may contain UTF characters (as 2, 3 or 4 bytes representing a unicode character). Encoding creates a string that can be used as a value where text representation of UTF is required. utf-text is performed according to \fBRFC7159\fP and \fBRFC3629\fP (UTF standard).

Note that hexadecimal characters used for Unicode (such as \eu21d7) are always lowercase. Solidus character ("/") is not escaped, although \fBtext-utf\fP will correctly process it if the input has it escaped.

The number of bytes in <utf> to be converted can be specified with <length> in "length" clause. If <length> is not specified, it is the length of string <utf>. Note that a single UTF character can be anywhere between 1 to 4 bytes. For example "—ô" is 2 bytes in length. 

The status of encoding can be obtained in number <status>. <status> is the string length of the result in <text> (or the number of bytes output if <text> is omitted), or -1 if error occurred (meaning <utf> is an invalid UTF) in which case <text> (if specified) is an empty string and the error text can be obtained in <error text> in "error-text" clause.

.SH EXAMPLES
Convert UTF string to text and verify the expected result:

.RS 4
.EX

// UTF string 
set-string utf_str = "\[char92]"Doc\[char92]"\en\et\eb\ef\er\et‚áó‚áò\et‚ñ∑‚óÆùÑû·è´‚≤†—à\en/\[char92]"()\et"

// Convert UTF string to text
utf-text utf_str status encstatus to text_text

// This is the text expected
(( expected_result
@\[char92]"Doc\[char92]"\en\et\eb\ef\er\et\eu21d7\eu21d8\et\eu25b7\eu25ee\eud834\eudd1e\eu13eb\eu2ca0\eu0448\en/\[char92]"()\et
))

// Make sure conversion was okay, decs is the length of the result (encj string)
if-true text_text equal expected_result and encstatus not-equal -1
    @decode-text worked okay
end-if
