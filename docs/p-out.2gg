.SH DESCRIPTION
p-out outputs a <string>, without any encoding (meaning a string is output exactly as it appears). 

If "length" clause is used, then only <length> leading bytes of <string> are output. 

If "new-line" clause is used, then a new line ("\en") is output after <string>.

Note that all bytes of <string> are output, even if <string> contains null-bytes.

.SH EXAMPLES

.RS 4
.EX

set-string mydata="Hello world"
p-out mydata

.RS 4
.EX

p-out "This is a non-encoded output<br/>" new-line
p-out "<hr/>"
