.SH DESCRIPTION
p-url is the same as \fBp-out\fP, except that the output is URL-encoded. This means such output is suited for use in URL parameters.

If "length" clause is used, then only <length> leading bytes of <string> are URL-encoded and then output. 

If "new-line" clause is used, then a new line ("\en") is output after encoded <string>.

.SH EXAMPLES
Create a URL based on arbitrary strings used as URL parameters - for instance a space would be encoded as "%20" in the final output:

.RS 4
.EX

@<a href='<<p-path>>/update?item=<<p-url item_name>>'>Update</a>
