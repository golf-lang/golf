connect-haproxy-tcp-socket \- Golf documentation (web-servers)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This shows how to connect your application listening on TCP port <port number> (started with "-p" option in \fBmgrg\fP) to HAProxy load balancer.

HAProxy can balance the load between different web servers, which in turn are connected to your applications. Since in this case HAProxy does not directly communicate with a Golf application (which is behind a web server), you may lookup examples of this online.

When you want HAProxy to directly communicate with a Golf application server, you may use configuration similar to this (shown is just a bare-bone setup needed to accomplish the goal):

.RS 4
.EX

global
    user haproxy
    group haproxy
    daemon

defaults
    mode    http
    timeout connect 5000
    timeout client  50000
    timeout server  50000
    errorfile 400 /etc/haproxy/errors/400.http
    errorfile 403 /etc/haproxy/errors/403.http
    errorfile 408 /etc/haproxy/errors/408.http
    errorfile 500 /etc/haproxy/errors/500.http
    errorfile 502 /etc/haproxy/errors/502.http
    errorfile 503 /etc/haproxy/errors/503.http
    errorfile 504 /etc/haproxy/errors/504.http

frontend front_server
    mode http

    option forwardfor

fcgi-app golf-fcgi
    log-stderr global
    docroot /var/lib/gg/func_test/app
    path-info ^.+(/func_test)(/.+)$ 

backend backend_servers                                                                                                                     
    mode http
    filter fcgi-app golf-fcgi
    use-fcgi-app golf-fcgi

Restart HAProxy:

.RS 4
.EX

sudo systemctl restart haproxy

Note that Golf application path is "/func_test" (and the application name may or may not be the same, see \fBrequest\fP). The TCP port of the application is "2301" (could be any port number you choose that's greater than 1000 and lower than 65535). 

HAProxy itself is bound to port 90, and "path_reg" specifies which URLs will be passed to your Golf application (i.e. they must have "/func_test/" in the URL). "path-info" specifies SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO (as "()" regular sub-expressions), which are as such passed to your Golf application. "docroot" is set to the application home directory (see \fBdirectories\fP).

A Golf aplication (named "func_test") would have been started with (using the same application name "func_test" and TCP port "2301"):

.RS 4
.EX

mgrg -p 2301 func_test

.EE
.RE

Now you should be able to connect and load-balance your Golf application servers directly from HAProxy.
